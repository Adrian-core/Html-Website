        <h2>Italian Pasta Cabonara</h2>

        <article>
		  <p>
		  Pasta Carbonara is a classic Italian dish known for its creamy sauce made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pepper. Here's a basic recipe for you:
<br>
### Ingredients:
<ul>
<li> 400g (14 oz) spaghetti or your favorite pasta </li>
<li> 150g (5 oz) pancetta or guanciale, diced </li>
<li> 3 large eggs </li>
<li> 1 cup (about 100g) grated Pecorino Romano cheese </li>
<li> 1/2 cup (about 50g) grated Parmesan cheese </li>
<li> 2 cloves garlic, minced (optional) </li>
<li> Freshly ground black pepper, to taste </li>
<li> Salt, to taste </li>
<li> Olive oil (for cooking)</li>
</ul>

### Instructions:
<br>

<ol>

<li> Cook the Pasta:
<ul>
  <li>  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
  <li> Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente.
  <li> Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.
</ul>
</li>

<br>

<li> Prepare the Sauce:
<ul>
  <li> - In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, and Parmesan cheese. Set aside.
  <li> - Heat a bit of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta (or guanciale) and cook until it's crispy and golden brown. If using garlic, add it and saut√© until fragrant.
</ul>
</li>

<br>

<li> Combine Pasta and Sauce:
<ul>
  <li> - Add the drained pasta to the pan with the pancetta (or guanciale) and toss to coat.
  <li> - Remove the pan from heat, and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta. Toss the pasta until the sauce thickens and coats the noodles. If needed, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to achieve a creamy consistency.
</ul>
</li>

<br>

<li> Season and Serve
<ul>
  <li>Season the pasta with freshly ground black pepper. Be cautious with salt, as the pancetta and cheese are already salty.
  <li> Serve immediately, garnished with extra grated cheese and black pepper if desired.
</ul>
</li>

<br>

Enjoy your homemade Italian Pasta Carbonara! Feel free to customize it to your liking by adding more cheese, adjusting the level of pepper, or experimenting with different pasta shapes.
