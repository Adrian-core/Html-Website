        <h2> Classic Empanada </h2>

        <article>
		  <p>
		 Here's a detailed recipe for making classic beef empanadas. This recipe combines a homemade dough with a savory beef filling, common in various cuisines but with a special focus on Latin American flavors.
<br>
<br>

Ingredients:
<br>
<br>
For the Dough:

<ul>
<li> 3 cups all-purpose flour </li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
<li> 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold and cubed </li>
<li> 1 egg </li>
<li> 1/2 cup water (adjust as needed) </li>
</ul>

<br>

For the Beef Filling:
<ul>
<li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
<li> 1 large onion, finely chopped </li>
<li> 2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
<li> 1 pound ground beef </li>
<li> 1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
<li> 1 teaspoon paprika </li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste) </li>
<li> Salt and pepper to taste </li>
<li> 1/2 cup beef broth </li>
<li> 1/2 cup tomato sauce </li>
<li> 1/2 cup green olives, chopped </li>
<li> 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped (optional) </li>
<li> 1/4 cup raisins (optional) </li>
</ul>

Instructions:
<br>
Prepare the Dough:
<br>

<ol>
<li>Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. </li>
<li>Add Butter: Incorporate the cold, cubed butter into the flour mixture using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
<li>Add Egg and Water: Beat the egg lightly and mix it into the flour mixture. Gradually add water and knead until a smooth dough forms.<br> You may need a little more or less water, so add it slowly until the dough comes together well.</li>
<li>Chill the Dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<br>
Make the Beef Filling:
<ol>
<li>Cook Onion and Garlic: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking until they are soft and translucent.</li>
<li>Brown the Beef: Add the ground beef to the skillet, breaking it apart with a spoon. Cook until browned.</li>
<li>Add Spices and Liquids: Stir in the cumin, paprika, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Add the beef broth and tomato sauce, simmering the mixture until most of the liquid has evaporated.</li>
<li>Add Olives and Optional Ingredients: Stir in the chopped olives, and if using, the hard-boiled eggs and raisins. Remove from heat and let the filling cool.</li>
</ol>
Assemble and Cook the Empanadas:
<ol>
<li>Preheat Oven to 375째F (190째C) if baking. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
<li>Roll Out Dough: On a floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/8 inch thickness. Cut out round disc shapes using a large cookie cutter or a small bowl.</li>
<li>Fill Empanadas: Place a spoonful of the beef mixture in the center of each dough round. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Use a fork to crimp the edges and seal the empanada.</li>
<li>For Baking: Brush each empanada with beaten egg. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
<li>For Frying: Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pan to 360째F (182째C). Fry the empanadas in batches until golden brown, then drain on paper towels.</li>
</ol>
Serve:
Enjoy your beef empanadas hot, accompanied by salsa, guacamole, or your choice of dipping sauce.
