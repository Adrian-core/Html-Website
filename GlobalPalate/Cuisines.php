			<h3>Italian Pasta Carbonara</h3>
</a>
			<p>One popular theory suggests that Pasta Carbonara has its roots in a dish prepared by coal miners
			(carbonai) in the Apennine Mountains. The miners, who used to work in harsh conditions,
			would make a simple pasta dish using readily available ingredients like eggs, cured pork cheek (guanciale), and pepper.
			The name "carbonara" itself is derived from "carbonai."

			<h3>Japanese Sushi Rolls</h3>
</a>
			<p>Sushi originated in Japan. The term "sushi" refers to a dish that consists of vinegared rice combined
			with various ingredients, such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits.
			The origins of sushi can be traced back to the rice preservation techniques used in Southeast Asia,
			where fish was fermented with rice to keep it edible for a longer period.</p>

			<h3>Classic Empanada</h3>
</a>
			<p>The empanada, a filled pastry or dough pocket, has a history that spans various cultures and regions.
			The concept of enclosing a filling in dough and baking or frying it is not specific to one country or culture.
			Different versions of empanadas have emerged independently in various parts of the world. The recipe I have takes focus on the ones known in latin america</p>
